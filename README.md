# Marble Dash (Temporary title)

The idea is to combine the mechanics of the classical wooden marble maze and its
controls with a procedurally generated dungeon crawl. Enemies do turnbased actions
and while the player is real-time it may only hit the same enemy once per turn. In
level collectable is only coins but upon eliminating all enemies on a level the
store portal spawns in one of the holes on that level (and jumps around every X seconds).
Damage dealt to enemy is regulated with the speed that the player has while colliding with
the enemy.

The game is permadeath and you may not fall down a single hole (at the moment).

The game should be balanced so that if the player keeps pace with the intended difficulty
in the game the player should only need hitting the enemy once or twice before killing it.

## HELP?

Yes please! I would love collaborating on this project. A warning, I have a nasty habit of falling out
of love with my projects and as I'm too often doing them by myself, I abandon them. I think it would be
less likely if it was a collab. But now you know. 

It should be quite obvious, if things on this help-side haven't changed, that pretty is a serious shortcoming.

**But I rather steal your code and assets. Can I steal them?**

They are here, so of course you can.

**Sure but will you come hunt me with some nasty law firm?**

No I won't but wouldn't it be nicer and more fun if we collaborated?

**No, I don't like collaboration**

Fine, but please attribute me in some relevant manner.

**NO!**

*Sigh*, sure go ahead. But can you maybe at least let me know so I can see the potential success of your clone?

## Envisioned features

*Most features are described as issues on github*

The idea of putting the player through hard decisions about short time survival versus
long time survival feels like a core aspect.

Some early testing says that the player ball needs to be powered enough to either swiftly kill enemy
or just flee. The latter of course becomes a problem because it rules out opening up the store.

Because balance and precision in controls is critical to player success, adding elements that forces the
player to do quick/stressed movements should increase the fun. It is critical that the player feels that
they are responisble for putting themselves in this situation, i.e. it should not feel random.
